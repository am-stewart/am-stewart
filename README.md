### 👋 Hi, I'm Allison!

👩🏻‍🏫 Teaching was my passion.

After beginning college as a banking and finance major, I quickly realized that teaching is where my heart was. I changed majors, completed my degree, and was able to get a job as an elementary teacher in rural New Hampshire. I loved my job and had a passion for it that just felt natural. It felt like that's what I was meant to do. Until it didn't. Over the course of a couple years I found my passion for teaching beginning to fade and decided to take a step back. 

It was that same time that we also had to relocate due to my husband's job. I took that as the perfect opportunity to do some exploring and decide "what I wanted to be when I grew up". It's never too late right? I explored other avenues in education, the fitness industry, medical industry, but nothing made me feel as good as I did when I was in the thick of teaching.

I think the whole time I was exploring those careers, I had the idea of coding and software development in the back of my mind but was too afraid to make the leap. After talking with a friend who works closely with software developers, he advised me that he thought it would be something I would love. He told me about Lambda School (now Bloom Institute of Technology), which allows you the freedom of attending the school with no financial obligation until you get hired. With nothing to lose I decided to jump. I have never been so happy with a decision as I am with this one. The only thing I regret is that I didn't do it sooner. I can't wait to continue learning and growing as a software developer!
